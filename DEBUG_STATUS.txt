Summary of current status:

## Backend ✅ COMPLETE
- **20 courses seeded** with correct structure
- Each subject has 2-3 courses minimum
- Each course has 120+ problems minimum
- API verified working: `GET /api/student/courses/1` returns all 20 courses

## Course Distribution (as requested):
- C: 3 courses (150, 130, 120 problems)
- Python: 3 courses (140, 150, 125 problems)

## Frontend Issue ❌
- Page shows "No courses found"
- Need to debug why API response isn't displaying
- Added debug panel to see what's being loaded

## Next Steps:
1. User refreshes /student/courses page
2. Check debug panel (gray box at top)
3. Check browser console (F12) for API logs
4. Fix whatever is blocking the display
